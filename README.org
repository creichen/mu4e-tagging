* mu4e-tagging mode

~mu4e-tagging~ is a minor mode intended for use on top of ~mu4e~.  It offers:
- shortcut keybindings for adding/removing tags (out of a predefined category of tags)
- a custom ~mu4e-headers~ visualisation column, ~short-tags~, that displays shortened (and propertized) tags
- functions to quickly filter for these predefined tags
- Two types of tags:
  - *categorical* tags, which are mutually exclusive with each otehr
  - *flags*, which can be toggled individually

** Status

Usable (modulo limitations listed below), but:
- API / configuration interface is still subject to change
- Documentation consists mostly of docstrings (and the test suite)

** How to use

- Put ~mu4e-tagging.el~ into your load path
- Require ~mu4e-tagging~
- Set up ~mu4e-headers-fields~ to display ~short-tags~ as one of the headers
- Run ~(mu4e-tagging-setup-default-bindings)~ or set up your own bindings
  - You can then toggle ~mu4e-tagging~ mode by pressing ~C-t~ from within ~mu4e-headers~ mode
- Customise your ~mu4e-tagging-tags~

** Limitations

Tags are stored in your maildir headers, which means that they most
likely won't get synchronished with your imap server (I don't know if
~mu4e~ supports non-IMAP/maildir setups; the situation might be
different there).

Thus, to synchronise, you may need a custom solution/workaround.
